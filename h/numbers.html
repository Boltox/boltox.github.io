                <p>The new split in SoloQ has been rough for <a href="https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/boltox" class="OpGGLink">Boltox</a>.
                    Here are some of the pictures about bad game days.</p>

                    <h2>League Of Legends Roles</h2>
                </header>
                    <p>There are 5 roles in the game</p>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>            
                            <li>TOP</li>
                            <li>JUNGLE</li>
                            <li>MID</li>
                            <li>ADC</li>
                            <li>SUPPORT</li>
                        </strong>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Toplane</strong> is a solo lane where mostly people play tanks or bruisers and get 0 help and fight.</p>
                    <p><strong>Jungle</strong> is a lane where you dont lane against an enemy but you kill camps and objectives or help your laners.</p>
                    <p><strong>Midlane</strong> is a solo lane in the middle of the map where you can basically play everything but mostly mages and assassins.</p>
                    <p><strong>ADC</strong> is a role in botlane where you play marksman champions mostly and are the damage dealer and the focus point.</p>
                    <p><strong>Support</strong> is a role in botlane where you play supportive champions either enchanters or tank/engage champions.</p>
                    <p>As we can see <strong>Mr.Boltox</strong> has played two different roles in his losses<br>
                        which is really bad to do, because every player should play only one role.</p>

                    <h2><a href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Boltox" class="fandom">Esports</a></h2>
                    <p>Esports is really big in League Of Legends and Boltox is also in the esport scene</p>
                    <p>There are different regions across the world and right now China and Korea are the best leagues.</p>
                    <p>Worlds, the biggest event of the year in League Of Legends and it only happens once. Its when all the regions meet and fight for the trophy and be the best.</p>
                    <p>Boltox plays in the lower divisons so he doesn't earn money in the esports yet, but he plays in the best Finnish team.</p>
                    <p>Competitive gameplay is really different than soloq gameplay and thats why it doesn't really matter that Boltox has dropped from the best rank to 3rd best tier.</p>
